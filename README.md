# Waste_Classificaion_Using_Convolutional_Neural_Network
This project focuses on classifying waste materials using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a dataset downloaded from Kaggle. The goal is to automate the detection and classification of trash into five distinct categories: paper , glass , metal , plastic and cardboard.

Waste_Classification_Model.ipynb
Contains the training pipeline for the CNN model, including preprocessing, training, and saving the model.

Waste_Classification_Detection.ipynb
This notebook loads the trained model and allows the user to input an image. The model then predicts the category of the waste item.
